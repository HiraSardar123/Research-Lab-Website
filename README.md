# Research-Lab-Website
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Research Lab Website project. The project focuses on developing a comprehensive website for a research lab, providing a platform for collaboration, information sharing, and efficient data management. The development process involves learning essential web development frameworks, creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), building a MySQL database, and implementing the frontend and backend components of the website.

# Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Overview
The ERD defines entities, relationships, and attributes crucial for effective data management. Key entities include Researcher, User, Publication, Lab Head, and Project, with various relationships and attributes outlined.

# Methodology
## Database Schema Development

Convert the ER-diagram to a relational schema in SQL with a minimal number of tables.
Add appropriate records to the database.
## Normalizing Database

Further normalize the database to eliminate redundancies.
## Frontend Development

Build the frontend using CSS to create an interactive and attractive GUI.
## Backend Development

Use Python Flask web development framework for backend development.
# Tools
## MySQL

A robust relational database management system for efficient database development and maintenance.
## Python

A versatile and powerful programming language for backend development.
## HTML

Fundamental language for defining the structure and content of web pages.

## CSS

Crucial technology for styling the visual presentation of web pages.
## Microsoft Visio

A powerful tool for designing clear and comprehensible ER diagrams during the initial design phase.
Feel free to explore the source code and documentation to understand the project's structure and contribute to its development.
