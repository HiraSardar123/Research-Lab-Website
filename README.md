# Research-Lab-Website
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Research Lab Website project. The project focuses on developing a comprehensive website for a research lab, providing a platform for collaboration, information sharing, and efficient data management. The development process involves learning essential web development frameworks, creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), building a MySQL database, and implementing the frontend and backend components of the website.

# Project Progress
## 1. Online Learning of Frameworks
In the initial phase, we dedicated time to learning essential web development frameworks such as CSS, HTML, etc., ensuring the incorporation of modern technologies into the project.

## 2. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Development
We created a detailed ERD to visualize the database structure, identifying entities, relationships, and attributes crucial for effective data management.

## 3. Database Creation in MySQL
Building upon the ERD, we implemented a robust relational database using MySQL, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and normalization.

## 4. Web Page Development
The development of the initial web page marked a significant advancement in the project, translating theoretical concepts into a tangible product.

# Achievements
## Developing Initial Web Page

Successfully translated theoretical concepts and frameworks into a tangible web page.
## Designing ERD

Created a comprehensive Entity-Relationship Diagram, laying the groundwork for an efficient and well-organized database structure.
# Challenges
## Time Management

Effectively balancing learning new concepts, web page development, and ERD design required careful planning and prioritization.
## Online Learning of Web Development Concepts

The transition from theoretical understanding to practical implementation posed a challenge, demanding dedicated effort and hands-on practice.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Overview
The ERD defines entities, relationships, and attributes crucial for effective data management. Key entities include Researcher, User, Publication, Lab Head, and Project, with various relationships and attributes outlined.

# Methodology
## Database Schema Development

Convert the ER-diagram to a relational schema in SQL with a minimal number of tables.
Add appropriate records to the database.
## Normalizing Database

Further normalize the database to eliminate redundancies.
## Frontend Development

Build the frontend using CSS to create an interactive and attractive GUI.
## Backend Development

Use Python Flask web development framework for backend development.
# Tools
## MySQL

A robust relational database management system for efficient database development and maintenance.
## Python

A versatile and powerful programming language for backend development.
## HTML

Fundamental language for defining the structure and content of web pages.
## CSS

Crucial technology for styling the visual presentation of web pages.
## Microsoft Visio

A powerful tool for designing clear and comprehensible ER diagrams during the initial design phase.
